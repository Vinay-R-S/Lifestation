## 4. Conclusion

The Requirements Traceability Matrix demonstrates complete coverage of all identified requirements for the LifeStation application. Each requirement has been verified through at least one test case, with many requirements verified through multiple test cases. The test results confirm that all requirements have been successfully implemented and the application is ready for release.

All tests have been executed and passed successfully, indicating that the application meets both its functional and non-functional requirements. Two additional tests (UT-12 and PT-11) were conducted as supporting tests for security validation and performance optimization respectively.
